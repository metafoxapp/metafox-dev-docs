# Export Package

After development complete, you need export package to upload to [appstore.phpfox.com](https://appstore.phpfox.com/manage-packages/).
MetaFox's clients can buy/install it directly from store.

`appstore.phpfox.com` require a zip file with file contents structure.

## Environment
WARN: if your package contains frontend source code, backend server have to access to frontend source code before run export.

```text
APP_ENV="local"
MFOX_FRONTEND_ROOT="/path/to/frontend root"
```

## Filesystem

Generally, the folder structure of the app is as below
```text
|- backend
|   |- packages
|       |- [vendor]
|           |- [app name]
|               |- composer.json
|               |- config
|               |- src
|- frontend
    |- packages
        |- [vendor]
            |- [app name]
                |- package.json
                |- tsconfig.json
                |- src
```

A package isn't required to have both `backend` and `frontend` folders. If your apps don't need to have *Frontend* or *Backend*, you can exclude the corresponding folder. 
The *Language* package can include only the `backend` folder only.

## Manual Export

Export package if you can access frontend source from backend server directly.

- Create a new empty directory `export`
- Copy the *Frontend* to `export/frontend/packages/[vendor]/[app name]`
- Copy *Backend* package to `export/backend/packages/[vendor]/[app name]`
- Compress all subfolders inside the `export` folder to ZIP format. On Linux or Mac machine, you can run following command in terminal: `cd export && zip export.zip -r .`
