# Intro

In this article, we will guide you how to develop a new app which allows user to share notes. End users are able to post new notes, edit their notes, share their own notes to Activity Feed, etc.

**Table Of Contents**

- Create a landing page of Note app
- Add an existing page to the Main Menu
- Add a new portable block
- Work with `apiClient`
- Display listing of items.

## Skeleton

Firstly, we are going to create a app skeleton. Let's open Terminal and move to the root of your workbox where the Frontend source code is located, then execute

```shell script
yarn create-app --package=@example/module-note --item=note
```

After running the above command, the skeleton of your Notes app will be created under `packages/example-notes` folder

## Directory Structure

```text
module-note/
  package.json
    src/
      components/
      containers/
      reducers/
      sagas/
      pages/
```

## Landing Page

Now, we will guide you step-by-step to add the Landing page at route `/note`.

**Step 1**: Create page components

```tsx
/**
 * @type: route
 * path: /note
 * pageName: note.langing
 */

#file pages/HomePage/HomePage.tsx

import * as React from 'react';
import { Page } from '@metafox/framework';

const HomePage = props => {
  return (
    <Page pageName="note.home"  pageLayout={{}} />
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

**Step 02**: Declare layouts

Add new file `src/pages/HomePage/package.json`

```json
{ "main": "HomePage.tsx" }
```

**Step 03**: Verify

Reload browser and redirect to `/note` to verify result.

## Configure Layout

Add new file `pages/HomePage/layout.json` with the below content

```tsx
{
  blocks: [
  ],
}
```

Then, we will configure blocks in next section

## Block

Create custom block, to view simple featured notes.

**Step 01**: Create a Block

Add new file `components/BlockFeatureNotes.tsx` with the below content

```tsx
/**
 * @type: block
 * name: note.block.featuredNotes
 */

import * as React from 'react';

import {createBlock} from '@metafox/framework';

// Implement base component
const BlockFeatureNotes = ({
  title = 'Featured Notes',
}: Props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>{title}</h4>
      <div>Display Featured Notes</div>
    </div>
  );
};


export default createBlock({
  extendBlock: BlockFeatureNotes
});
```

**Step 02**: Verify

Open live edit mode, click on `Add new block`, you will see the `Featured Notes` block here.

You can choose the block to add and then export layout to other pages.
