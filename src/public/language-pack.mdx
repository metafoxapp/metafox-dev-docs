## Create a new Language pack

In this article, we will guide you step by step to create a new language pack.

Firstly, please go to **AdminCP > Apps** and click on the **Add Language** button. The, follow wizard and fill the info of your language pack. For example, to create a French language pack, you can use the language code as `fr` , Vendor name as _Company_ and App Name as _French Pack_.

On the server, the `packages/company/french-pack/language/fr` directory will be generated automatically. Its subdirectories contain namespaced and grouped translations. And, `_root` directory contains no namespaced translations.

Let's go to `packages/company/french-pack/language/fr` directory and dive deeper into `activity/permisson.php` file which contains phrases of _permissions_ in _Activity_ app

```php
<?php
 /* this is auto generated file */
 return [
    'can_can_purchase_sponsor_feed' => 'Activity Feed Can Purchase Sponsor Permission',
    'can_can_sponsor_feed_feed' => 'Activity Feed Can Sponsor Feed Permission',
    'can_create_activity_post' => 'Activity Post Create Permission',
    'can_create_activity_snooze' => 'Activity Snooze Create Permission',
    'can_create_feed' => 'Activity Feed Create Permission',
    'can_delete_activity_post' => 'Activity Post Delete Permission',
    'can_delete_activity_snooze' => 'Activity Snooze Delete Permission',
    'can_delete_feed' => 'Activity Feed Delete Permission',
    'can_hide_feed' => 'Activity Feed Hide Permission',
    'can_moderate_activity_post' => 'Activity Post Moderate Permission',
    'can_moderate_activity_snooze' => 'Activity Snooze Moderate Permission',
    'can_moderate_feed' => 'Activity Feed Moderate Permission',
    'can_update_activity_post' => 'Activity Post Update Permission',
    'can_update_activity_snooze' => 'Activity Snooze Update Permission',
    'can_update_feed' => 'Activity Feed Update Permission',
    'can_view_activity_post' => 'Activity Post View Permission',
    'can_view_activity_snooze' => 'Activity Snooze View Permission',
    'can_view_feed' => 'Activity Feed View Permission'
];
```

Now, you can update phrase values for _French_ language with any text editor tool. You can also refer to [Example Translation](/example/#translation) for more details.

To keep your language pack easy to maintain, please do not add multiple languages in to single language pack.

## Export Package

After updating and saving translation phrases on `.php` files, you can export language pack in **AdminCP**.
