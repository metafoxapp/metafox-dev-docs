# MetaFox Installation

## System Requirements

On the Development environment: since we have to build MetaFox Frontend, your server will need to have at least 4G RAM as the [Recommendation for React](https://reacts.com/system-requirements/)

MetaFox can be installed with docker or standalone. 

## Installation with Docker

MetaFox is going to support MySQL and Postgres. For Development environment, we highly recommend using Postgres

The fastest way to install MetaFox Backend is via `docker-compose`. Your server will need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed first. Please refer to [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). 

### Installation Steps

1. Download MetaFox package in Client Area and extract the package on your server. For example, all source file will be uploaded to your server under `home/metafox` folder

2. Open Terminal and log in SSH to your server. It is necessary to note that you will need to log in with SSH user having permissions to run docker

3. Copy the `/home/metafox/backend/.env.example` to `/home/metafox/backend/.env` . There are many environments supported by MetaFox that you may want to take a look. However, we can use the default configuration at this time.

4. Copy `/home/metafox/backend/.env` to `/home/metafox/.env`

5. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Configure the owner of source folder to daemon
chown -R daemon:daemon /home/metafox

# Go to source folder of the backend
cd /home/metafox/backend

# Start docker-compose container
docker-compose up -d

```

The MetaFox should be running at "http://your_server_IP" or "http://your_domain"

## Standalone Installation

In this case, follow step by step to install MetaFox Backend standalone.

In order for MetaFox to work properly, please check to make sure that your server meets the following software requirements: 
- OS: Linux is recommended
- Web server: Apache or NginX
- Database: Postgres or MySQL. Postgres is recommended
- PHP >= 7.4
- PHP Extensions:
    - ext-curl
    - ext-dom
    - ext-json
    - ext-pdo
    - ext-zip
    - sodium
    - pcov
    - php-redis
    - php-imgclick
    - php-memcached
    - php-pgsql
    - php-mysql
    - php-ffmpeg

### Installation Steps

1. Download source package in [Client Area](https://clients.phpfox.com/) and extract it to a temporary folder on your server

2. The MetaFox source includes 2 main folders: `frontend` and `backend`. You can copy all source files under `backend` folder to the web root folder fo web server.

3. Go to the web root folder of web server, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update environment variables for:
  - Database
  - Cache

4. Go to Terminal, go to the web root folder and run the following command:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```
