# Commands

In this topic, we are going to discuss about most frequently commands which can be executed on Linux terminals.

We'll assume that you are familiar with Linux terminals. Before we go on to the list of commands, please open the terminal, log in SSH to the `Backend` server, and go to the source folder of MetaFox Backend.

If the MetaFox Backend is set up  with a Docker container, you can run the ```docker exec``` command to log into the running container.

Here is a list of Linux commands:

```bash

# Listing all supported commands
php artisan list

# Fresh install metafox platform
bash ./scripts/install.sh

# Update metafox
php artisan metafox:update
```
